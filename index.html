<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
<div>
	<a name="intro"></a>
	<img src="slides/slides0002.png"/>
	<div>
	So... I heard you like graphs.
	<br><br>
	<code>[laughter]</code>
	<br><br>
	Well, here's a completely made-up graph
	based off an unscientific survey of two anecdotes.
	How informed we are, versus how much information we have.
	Obviously, the more information we have...
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0003.png"/>
	<div>
	...the <i>less</i> informed we are,
	because now there's too much noise, not enough signal.
	Too much haystack, not enough needle.
	We can't tell what really <i>matters</i> anymore.
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0005.png"/>
	<div>
	Here's another graph.
	<br><br>
	How <i>connected</i> we are, versus how much information we have.
	Again, obviously, the more information we have...
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0006.png"/>
	<div>
	...the <i>less</i> connected we are, because with the internet,
	you can find whatever information you want that already confirms
	your pre-existing biases and beliefs. More information is making
	us more polarized.
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0008.png"/>
	<div>
	Here's another another graph.
	<br><br>
	How <i>empowered</i> we are, versus how m--
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0009.png"/>
	<div>
	Let's just skip to the punchline.
	The more you learn, the more you realize everything's awful.
	It's all too complex, and out of your control!
	You can't <i>do</i> anything about it.
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0010.png"/>
	<div>
	So. I heard you like graphs.
	<br><br>
	That's why we're here at this conference, isn't it?
	Because we like to make visualizations and interactives,
	to make information more accessible. We're doing this
	because we want to make people...
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0011.png"/>
	<div>
	...more informed,
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0012.png"/>
	<div>
	...more connected,
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0013.png"/>
	<div>
	...and more empowered,
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0014.png"/>
	<div>
	but if what we do ‚Äì pumping more and more information out there ‚Äì
	accomplishes the complete <i>opposite</i> of that?...
	Then, well, the question for us media-makers and journalists
	in the internet age is <i>not</i> ‚Äúcan our field survive‚Äù, but
	‚Äúdoes our field <i>deserve</i> to survive.‚Äù
	<br><br>
	<i>That</i> is our existential crisis.
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0017.png"/>
	<div>
	<code>[unsettled laughter]</code>
	</div>
</div>


<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0019.png"/>
	<div>
	Seriously though, it's a big problem.
	But to be fair, data visualization already solves half the issue.
	Because dataviz lets us go from individual stories...
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0020.png"/>
	<div>
	...to the larger patterns.
	But I think it's time for us to go deeper.
	Because if what's under those stories are patterns,
	what's under those patterns...
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0021.png"/>
	<div>
	...are <i>systems.</i>

<!-- PART ONE: (UN)INFORMED -->

	<a name="uninformed"></a>
	<h3>
		PART A: (UN)INFORMED
		<a class="chapter_link" href="#uninformed"><img src="img/link.svg"/></a>
	</h3>
	So our problem is we have too much information, but not enough deep understanding.
	Patterns can only tell us <i>how</i> things happen, but not <i>why</i> things happen.
	For that, we need systems.
	<br><br>
	We already know what dataviz looks like ‚Äì what would ‚Äúsystem viz‚Äù look like?
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="vids/sim.png"/>
	<div>
	One tool I think might help is <i>simulation.</i>
	<br><br>
	Here's a project I made a few months ago,
	<a href="http://ncase.me/simulating">Simulating The World (In Emoji üòò)</a>
	<br><br>
	It's a website full of simulations
	where readers can play with them, change the rules,
	and even create their own emoji-simulation!
	These simulations were meant to teach a variety of <i>systems</i>,
	such as...
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<video width="400" controls loop>
		<source src="vids/sim_forest.mp4" type="video/mp4">
		Your browser does not support the video tag.
	</video>
	<div>
	Ecosystems, and why forest fires are actually good for the forest.
	</div>
	<span class="caption">
	this is a looping video! click the play button to start it.
	</span>
</div>

<div>
	<video width="400" controls loop>
		<source src="vids/sim_sick.mp4" type="video/mp4">
		Your browser does not support the video tag.
	</video>
	<div>
	Epidemiology, how disease spreads, what herd immunity is, and why it's important.
	<br><br>
	<code>[a "huh." from the audience]</code>
	</div>
	<span class="caption">
	this one's a looping video, too.
	</span>
</div>

<div>
	<video width="400" controls loop>
		<source src="vids/sim_conflict.mp4" type="video/mp4">
		Your browser does not support the video tag.
	</video>
	<div>
	Finally, civic conflict.
	And how, much like wildfire or disease,
	violence can spread quickly throughout a population.
	<br><br>
	Now, of <i>course</i>, these sims aren't gonna be complicated.
	They're made in <i>emoji.</i> They're going to be very simplified.
	But I say that's not a bug, it's a feature!
	</div>
	<span class="caption">
	same.
	</span>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/map.png"/>
	<div>
	Think of a street map.
	<br><br>
	A street map is useful not <i>despite</i> being simplified,
	but <i>because</i> it's simplified.
	That's the power of models and simulations ‚Äì
	they cut away what doesn't matter, to clearly show what <i>does</i>.
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0025.png"/>
	<div>
	And that's the problem.
	Too many things in our news and media just <i>doesn't matter</i>.
	Or worse, they give people the entirely wrong impression.
	<br><br>
	For example, turn on your local cable news,
	and you're bound to get a nasty, gnarly, gruesome crime story.
	If that's the story you keep seeing, you'd think that crime is skyrocketing.
	And that <i>is</i> the US public perception nowadays.
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0026.png"/>
	<div>
	But if you look at the <i>trends</i>,
	you'll see that crime has been falling in the US since the 80's.
	But the trends only tell you <i>that</i> crime has fallen,
	but not <i>why</i>.
	<br><br>
	For that, you need to go beyond the things and trends, and down to...
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0027.png"/>
	<div>
	...the <i>theory</i>.
	<br><br>
	Sociology, criminology, psychology, economics, so on and so forth.
	Once you have theory, then you can design a more humane criminal justice system.
	Trends only let us extrapolate to the future.
	Theory lets us <i>create</i> the future.
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0028.png"/>
	<div>
	But, like Inception, we gotta go <i>deeper</i>.
	<br><br>
	<i>Is</i> there something deeper, that underlies
	all the theories we have? I think, yes!
	<br><br>
	I mean ‚Äì other than philosophy and mathematics and
	language and logic and the scientific method itself,
	there's also...
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0029.png"/>
	<div>
	...SYSTEMS!
	<br><br>
	Systems Thinking. What <i>is</i> systems thinking?
	It's a broad and interdisciplinary field,
	and honestly it's a bit wibbly-wobbly,
	but here's what it is at its core:
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0031.png"/>
	<div>
	Normally, we see things as a linear chain of cause-and-effect.
	A affects B affects C, and son.
	But what systems thinking says, is that the world is not <i>linear</i>...
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0032.png"/>
	<div>
	...it's <i>LOOPY!</i>
	<br><br>
	Vicious cycles, virtuous cycles,
	stabilizing and stagnating loops.
	A affects B, but sometimes, B can then affect A.
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0029.png"/>
	<div>
	So the next time you want to teach someone something,
	don't just stop at a single thing, a single story.
	Dig deeper. Go after the <i>system</i>.
	Because it's only once we understand the deep underlying systems...
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/map.png"/>
	<div>
	...can we then get to where we really want to go.
	</div>
</div>

<!-- PART TWO: (DIS)CONNECTED -->

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0034.png"/>

	<a name="disconnected"></a>
	<h3>
		PART B: (DIS)CONNECTED
		<a class="chapter_link" href="#disconnected"><img src="img/link.svg"/></a>
	</h3>
	But even if we're informed, we can still have polarized echo chambers.
	In fact, higher education correlates with higher partisanship, on both sides.
	So how do we overcome polarization?
	How can we create common ground between people with completely contradicting viewpoints?
	<br><br>
	To answer that,
	I'd like to show you a simulation I made one and a half years ago.
	It's an example of how systems thinking can <i>combine contradictions</i>.
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="vids/potp1.png"/>
	<div>
	<a href="http://ncase.me/polygons/">Parable of the Polygons</a>,
	an interactive blog post on discrimination and diversity.
	<br><br>
	Now, racism and sexism are very polarizing topics...
	<span style="font-size:12px">especially on the internet...</span>
	with lots of opposed, contradicting viewpoints.
	<br><br>
	One person could say, <i>look at the racial ratio in our incarceration system,
	look at the gender pay gap, clearly there's massive societal discrimination.</i>
	<br><br>
	But another person could reasonably respond, <i>well I'm not a racist or sexist,
	and nobody I know is, and there's a huge taboo against being one.
	So even if we're slightly biased, it can't be as massive as you say.</i>
	<br><br>
	Parable of the Polygons uses simulation to show something counterintuitive:
	it is possible for the <i>collective</i> to be highly biased,
	even if none of the <i>individuals</i> are.
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="vids/potp2.png"/>
	<div>
	First, the Parable sets up the rules.
	You, the reader, can move shape-people around a neighborhood.
	Each shape thinks,
	<br><br>
	<i>‚ÄúI wanna move if less than 1/3 of my neighbors are like me.‚Äù</i>
	<br><br>
	Note that this means that every one of them would be
	<i>happy being in the minority</i>. There is no massive bias here.
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<video width="400" controls>
		<source src="vids/potp_shuffle.mp4" type="video/mp4">
		Your browser does not support the video tag.
	</video>
	<div>
	And yet, if we start off with a randomly mixed neighborhood of
	triangles &amp; squares, and you drag unhappy shapes to random empty spots,
	without any foresight, what happens over time is...
	</div>
	<span class="caption">
	this is a video! click play to watch what happens to the shapes
	</span>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="vids/potp3.png"/>
	<div>
	...complete segregation.
	<br><br>
	And the reader is not merely <i>told</i> this, or <i>shown</i> this,
	they <i>create it for themselves, step-by-step</i>.
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0036.png"/>
	
	<div>
	And that's how two seemingly incompatible ideas ‚Äì 
	that most individuals have low bias,
	and society collectively has high bias ‚Äì
	can turn out to be different perspectives on the <i>same thing</i>.
	<br><br>
	Two things I want to emphasize:
	<br><br>
	One, I'm not saying this is how discrimination <i>always</i> works.
	I'm just saying it's <i>plausible</i>, especially for bottom-up systems.
	<br><br>
	Two, this is <i>not</i> just ‚Äúpresenting both sides‚Äù.
	If you do that, the reader will just succumb to confirmation bias,
	and remember the part that supports their beliefs,
	and forget the other parts. Instead, this is <i>combining</i> both sides ‚Äì
	making it so you can't understand one argument <i>without also understanding its opposite</i>.
	<br><br>
	Systems can <i>combine contradictions</i>.
	</div>

	<span class="caption">

</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0038.png"/>
	<div>
	Let's talk about conflict.
	<br><br>
	I hope you appreciate my masterful illustration of conflict.
	<br><br>
	Anyway, a few conflict mediators are now using Systems Thinking
	to resolve conflicts. This is how they do it:
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0039.png"/>
	<div>
	First, they get one side's story.
	Usually it'll be a linear cause-and-effect story.
	In this toy example, the story is 
	"they fought us, so we're just fighting back."
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0040.png"/>
	<div>
	But the other side also has their own story.
	Here, it's also
	"they fought us, so we're just fighting back."
	<br><br>
	And what the conflict mediator will do is show that the story
	isn't <i>linear</i>...
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0041.png"/>
	<div>
	...it's <i>LOOPY.</i>
	<br><br>
	In this case, it's an escalation of violence, an arms race, a vicious cycle.
	That's a pretty common kind of loop for people to get stuck in.
	<br><br>
	The mediator then makes both sides recognize this.
	That they're <i>both</i> trapped in the system.
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0042.png"/>
	<div>
	The <i>system</i> is their common enemy.
	<br><br>
	Not each other.
	<br><br>
	Then maybe, after they realize the trap they're in,
	people can start working together to overcome it.
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0043.png"/>
	<div>
	This might be where I would use the word, "empathy".
	<br><br>
	Now ‚Äì I <i>like</i> empathy, I've <i>made</i> stories and interactives "for empathy",
	but it's uh, getting to be kind of a buzzword.
	Not yet up there with "synergy", but maybe somewhere around "gamification."
	<br><br>
<pre style="padding-left:10px">[everyone laughs except for
the business people]
</pre>
	<br>
	But here's the problem with "empathy" ‚Äì it's too individual.
	Yes, you need to first start with understanding the individuals,
	but then you need to understand the <i>systems.</i>
	Even good people can get trapped in a bad system.
	<br><br>
	If too much information makes us feel polarized,
	Systems Thinking reminds us we're all connected ‚Äì 
	for better or worse.
	</div>
</div>

<!-- PART THREE: (DIS)EMPOWERED -->

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0045.png"/>
	<div>
	<a name="disempowered"></a>
	<h3>
		PART C: (DIS)EMPOWERED
		<a class="chapter_link" href="#disempowered"><img src="img/link.svg"/></a>
	</h3>
	But even if we're informed <i>and</i> connected,
	we can still feel <i>disempowered</i>,
	that we're all trapped in a system and can't do anything about it.
	So how do we overcome <i>that?</i> And, well...
	<br><br>
	...I don't know. I was hoping I'd come up with an answer
	by the time I was scheduled to give this talk,
	but given that political philosophers have been tackling that question for
	millennia, maybe I shouldn't be too surprised.
	<br><br>
	That said, I'd like to give you my half-baked thoughts on "how do we empower peeps",
	in the form of a prototype:
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="vids/prison_start.png" style="border:1px solid #eee"/>
	<div>
	This isn't out yet.
	<a href="http://ncase.me/prison-wip/model.html">(It's online, but not officially "out")</a>
	It's a prototype simulation of the US incarceration system,
	extended to schools and employment.
	<br><br>
	So you have a bunch of boxes: students at the top, employed &amp; unemployed in the middle,
	and the incarcerated at the bottom.
	Lil' simulated people move from box to box,
	randomly, with probabilities based off the real stats on
	race, age, income, education, and incarceration.
	<br><br>
	And you, the reader, can change those probabilities,
	to try out different policies and scenarios.
	To ask "what if", and more importantly,
	"what can <i>I</i> do to affect this system?"
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<video width="400" controls style="border:1px solid #eee">
		<source src="vids/prison.mp4" type="video/mp4">
		Your browser does not support the video tag.
	</video>
	<div>
	Let's run this simulation!
	<br><br>
	So, the people move from place to place, and you can also click an individual
	to focus on just <i>their</i> story.
	<br><br>
	And then, you can change probabilities for the box <i>you</i> most have control over.
	Like, if you're a teacher, you can use this sim to ask "what if I helped more low-income kids go to college?"
	Or if you're a business-owner, "what if I reached out to hire ex-cons?"
	Or if you're a policymaker, "what if I reduced, or eliminated, mandatory minimums for sentencing?"
	From there, you can see what affect you could have on the whole system!
	<br><br>
	(You can't really see the effects in this prototype. That's why it's still a prototype.
	I'll figure out the interface eventually)
	</div>
	<span class="caption">
	this is a video! (the last video, actually) click to play.
	</span>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0047.png"/>
	<div>
	Here's why I think people feel disempowered.
	Because we tell ourselves a linear story about how power flows.
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0048.png"/>
	<div>
	We think it all starts with the people on top,
	the government or corporations, who control‚Äì
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0049.png"/>
	<div>
	‚Äìthe middlemen, the media, who control‚Äì
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0050.png"/>
	<div>
	‚Äìan easily-manipulated majority, a gullible generation.
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0051.png"/>
	<div>
	And in a linear cause-and-effect world, there can only be one root cause.
	So in this story, if you're not at the very top of the hierarchy,
	then you have no power to change the system.
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0052.png"/>
	<div>
	But remember, the world's not linear, it's...
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0053.png"/>
	<div>
	<code>[audience shouts in unison: "LOOPY!"]</code>
	</div>
</div>


<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0054.png"/>
	<div>
	<i>Yeah!</i> Loopy!
	<br><br>
	And in a loopy system, there <i>is</i> no root cause.
	That's good.
	That means, no matter where you are in the system,
	what you do can have an effect, cycle through the loops,
	and ripple out through the entire system.
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0055.png"/>
	<div>
	As Parable of the Polygons showed,
	even small decisions within your local neighborhood
	can profoundly impact the global stage.
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0056.png"/>
	<div>
	So how can you change a whole system?
	Well... you can't.
	And frankly, you shouldn't.
	No <i>one</i> person should have that power.
	<br><br>
	You don't "fix" systems.
	You can only influence and evolve them,
	so they can <i>change themselves</i>.
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0057.png"/>
	<div>
	Let's make that more concrete.
	<br><br>
	For example, let's say you're a small business owner,
	and you decide to reach out and hire ex-cons.
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0058.png"/>
	<div>
	And let's say it works out.
	Then <i>your</i> peers in business see you're doing well,
	and do the same for their businesses.
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0059.png"/>
	<div>
	But just as you influenced your peer network,
	the ex-cons have their own peer networks:
	most likely people from poor, disadvantaged neighborhoods.
	The ex-cons who are given a second chance in society,
	can now influence and help out their at-risk friends.
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0060.png"/>
	<div>
	And let's say this spreads and spreads, a virtuous cycle,
	until public opinion on criminal justice changes.
	And so, public <i>pressure</i> on politicians changes,
	to force them into finally re-writing the laws.
	<br><br>
	In the linear story, change can only start at the top.
	But in this loopy system story, change goes from the bottom-up,
	and it's those at the top who are the <i>last</i> to change.
	And that's, maybe, how an individual can influence a system to change itself.
	<br><br>
	EASIER
	<br><br>
	SAID
	<br><br>
	THAN
	<br><br>
	DONE.
	<br><br>
	Again, and I cannot stress this enough, these are all half-baked thoughts,
	I don't have the answer, nobody has the answer, maybe nobody
	will <i>ever</i> have the answer.
	</div>
</div>


<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0013.png"/>
	<div>
	But systems thinking <i>is</i> powerful.
	It can help us
	understand things on a deeper level,
	overcome polarization and work together,
	and maybe ‚Äì just maybe ‚Äì it can help us <i>change the world!</i>
	</div>
</div>


<div>

</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0062.png"/>
	<div>
	So what.
	<br><br>
	I just gave you a whole bunch of theory,
	and not a lot of practical takeaways.
	You may be saying...
	<br><br>
	<i>Nicky, I got deadlines after this conference.
	I gotta learn D3. I'm only up to D2.</i>
	<br><br>
<pre style="padding-left:10px">
[laughter disguising the fact that
some of them probably *do* need to
learn D3.js for a looming deadline]
</pre>
	<br>
	<i>...so what do ya gots for me?</i>
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0063.png"/>
	<div>
	Well I'm glad you asked, hypothetical person,
	because now I'm gonna give you some practical tools
	to tell stories about systems, and systems about stories!
	<br><br>
	So, here are...
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0064.png"/>
	<div>
	<a name="tools"></a>
	<h3>
		FIVE TOOLS FOR SYSTEMS STORYTELLING
		<a class="chapter_link" href="#tools"><img src="img/link.svg"/></a>
	</h3>
	in order from least cray-cray to implement,
	to most cray-cray to implement.
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0065.png"/>
	<div>
	And the first tool is...
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0066.png"/>
	<div>
	...nothing.
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0067.png"/>
	<div>
	Or, at least, nothing <i>new</i>.
	You don't need simulations or interactivity.
	Because while it's still rare, people <i>have</i> successfully
	told stories about systems in other media!
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0068.png"/>
	<div>
	The quintessential example of system-storytelling is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wire">The Wire</a>.
	Each season is from a different perspective, a different part of the Baltimore criminal justice system.
	So if you make video or film, definitely check out The Wire.
	<br><br>
	Alternatively, if you make infographics or other visuals, check out Chris Ware's graphic novel,
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_Stories">Building Stories</a>.
	It's not a story about a system, but the storytelling is very nonlinear,
	with multiple perspectives in different points of time.
	It'd be great to see those devices used in a visualization of a real-world system!
	<br><br>
	And of course, there's the oldest mass medium, writing.
	You can also take inspiration for how to do nonlinear storytelling from "postmodern" literature
	like Kurt Vonnegut's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakfast_of_Champions">Breakfast of Champions</a>
	or ‚Äì one novel I read recently, not pictured here ‚Äì
	Jennifer Egan's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Visit_from_the_Goon_Squad">A Visit from the Goon Squad</a>.
	These novels use ensemble casts, because as we now know, a single perspective ‚Äì a single narrative ‚Äì
	is not only limiting, but possibly <i>inhumane.</i>
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0071.png"/>
	<div>
	The second tool is what I've been using for this entire talk:
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_loop_diagram">Causal Loop Diagrams</a>.
	<br><br>
	Basically, words and arrows. You draw whether A causes more or less of B,
	and the possible feedback loops. This picture you're seeing here is
	<a href="http://linchpin.org/site/?p=1009">my favorite example, about the war on drugs.</a>
	Specifically, heroin.
	I love this example so much because it's three whole stories
	about different parts of a system, compressed into
	<i>one loopy picture</i>.
	<br><br>
	The 1st loop, on the top-left, shows that if you seize heroin,
	you reduce heroin inventory in the short run. Duh.
	But reducing the inventory drives up the price,
	driving up the price drives up profits, and
	driving up profits means a greater incentive to <i>create more heroin</i>.
	And so on.
	<br><br>
	The 2nd loop also shows that if the price goes up,
	petty crime and theft goes up, since addicts <i>physically need</i> to support their addiction.
	This means more heroin users get arrested ‚Äì adding to our mass incarceration problem ‚Äì
	which reduces the number of drug "customers",
	which means drug dealers get an excess inventory.
	<br><br>
	Finally, the 3rd loop. When dealers have an excess inventory,
	they need to "market" it more, start pushing heroin onto susceptible youths,
	and create <i>even more addicts</i>, who will buy up their supply.
	<br><br>
	Those three loops could fill up <i>three whole documentaries</i>,
	but the Causal Loop Diagram is powerful enough to capture it all.
	I'd love to see you graphics designers use this!
	Because... all the loop diagrams I could find are really terribly designed.
	Even this example.
	I love it, but my eyes are bleeding.
	<br><br>
	Apparently academics don't know there's more fonts than just Times New Roman,
	and more shades of blue than hex code zero-zero-zero-zero-eff-eff.
	<br><br>
	<code>[pained sympathetic laughter]</code>
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0074.png"/>
	<div>
	Now we're getting into simulations!
	The third tool is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_and_flow">Stock &amp; Flow Model</a>.
	It's like a bathtub. A bathtub is your "stock", and water "flows" in and out.
	<br><br>
	Now what's really weird ‚Äì the earliest simulation I could find of a Stock &amp; Flow Model
	is not on an electronic computer, but a <i>water</i> computer.
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MONIAC">This is the MONIAC.</a>
	Instead of electricity flowing through wires,
	it's got water flowing through pipes. It was invented in 1949 by some
	New Zealander economist, to simulate the UK economy.
	For example, the treasury is a bathtub, and money flows in and out.
	<br><br>
	And researcher today still use stock &amp; flow models.
	Climate scientists model CO<sub>2</sub> flowing in and out of the atmosphere.
	Sociologists measure immigrants flowing in and out of a country.
	Basically, if you have any <i>thing</i> where <i>things</i> go in and out of that <i>thing</i>,
	you can use this tool to simulate it!
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0077.png"/>
	<div>
	The fourth tool is Probability Simulations.
	The dataviz community is actually already making a lot of use of this!
	And so I'll just go through a few examples:
	<br><br>
	<a href="http://flowingdata.com/2015/09/23/years-you-have-left-to-live-probably/">Years You Have Left to Live</a> 
	by Nathan Yau, which uses real CDC stats to simulate copies of you
	being born and dying... over and over... a hundred times per minute.
	Yeah that's kinda dark.
	<br><br>
	<a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2015/08/04/the-new-science-of-sentencing">Parole Simulator</a>
	by The Marshall Project &amp; FiveThirtyEight,
	which puts the reader in control of deciding what the risk cutoff rate should be for parole.
	The <i>reader</i> has to make that tradeoff.
	<br><br>
	<a href="http://blog.vctr.me/monty-hall/">Monty Hall Paradox Explained</a> by Victor Powell,
	which demonstrates the infamous mathematical paradox, via simulation.
	<br><br>
	<a href="http://rocknpoll.graphics/">Rock n' Poll</a> by Maarten Lambrechts,
	which uses simulations to explain what "margin of error" is,
	and why a 2% change in polling results isn't worth analyzing.
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0080.png"/>
	<div>
	Finally, on the deep end of the theoretical pool,
	we have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model">Agent-Based Modeling</a>.
	<br><br>
	Basically, an "agent" is a thing that makes decisions,
	and an agent-based model is several agents making decisions
	based off <i>each others' decisions</i>.
	Lots of loops.
	<br><br>
	Parable of the Polygons uses an agent-based model
	from Thomas Schelling, a Nobel Prize-winning economist.
	These models don't have to be grid-based,
	they can also be a network ‚Äì like social networks,
	economic networks, or political networks.
	<br><br>
	Agent-based models also have practical uses.
	They're used to design fire escapes, by simulating how crowds flow, and
	to design public health campaigns, by simulating how an epidemic can spread.
	<br><br>
	See? <i>SIMULATIONS SAVE LIVES.</i>
	<br><br>
	Anyway, now that you know the theory and tools, without further ado,
	I present to you...

		HOW TO SIMULATE THE UNIVERSE IN ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY-FOUR EASY STEPS
		<a class="chapter_link" href="#end"><img src="img/link.svg"/></a>
	</h3>
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0083.png"/>
	<div>
	...Step 1.
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0084.png"/>
	<div>
	Pick a thing. A specific individual's story you want to tell.
	You have to start with a <i>human</i> story, because that's the emotional hook
	that'll make people care, and the concrete case for your abstract system.
	<br><br>
	But don't stop there. Go deeper to...
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0085.png"/>
	<div>
	Step 2: the trends. The underlying patterns that your story is a part of.
	Then go even deeper, to...
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0086.png"/>
	<div>
	Step 3: the theory. <i>Why</i> the patterns are the way they are.
	You don't need to be an expert, but just figure out enough to understand...
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0087.png"/>
	<div>
	Step 4: the cause-and-effect <i>loops</i>.
	Like a street map, you can't and shouldn't consider <i>every</i> possible thing,
	but just get down what your core loops are.
	Once you have that...
	</div>
</div>


<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0088.png"/>
	<div>
	Step 5: pick the tool that works best for you, to tell the story of this system.
	And once you have a prototype...
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0089.png"/>
	<div>
	Step 6: iterate on that prototype. Then...
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0090.png"/>
	<div>
	Step 7: iterate on that prototype. Then...
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0096.png"/>
	<div>
	Step 8: iterate on that prototype. Then you just
	keep doing that for a while, until you've made something wonderful that really...
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0098.png"/>
	<div>
	informs people,
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0100.png"/>
	<div>
	connects people,
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0102.png"/>
	<div>
	and empowers people, and once you've done all that...
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0105.png"/>
	<div>
	Step 134... ship it!
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<img src="slides/slides0106.png"/>
	<div>
	And step 135, fix some bugs.
